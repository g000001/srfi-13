# SRFI 13 for CL: String Libraries

The prefix/suffix and comparison routines in this code had (extremely
distant) origins in MIT Scheme's string lib, and was substantially
reworked by Olin Shivers (shivers@ai.mit.edu) 9/98. As such, it is
covered by MIT Scheme's open source copyright. See below for details.

The KMP string-search code was influenced by implementations written
by Stephen Bevan, Brian Dehneyer and Will Fitzgerald. However, this
version was written from scratch by myself.

The remainder of this code was written from scratch by myself for scsh.
The scsh copyright is a BSD-style open source copyright. See below for
details.
